                To create a fun and enhancing experience for users, I have learned that as a Software 
                Developer, we can implement transitions and animations to make a user's viewing experience more interesting.
                CSS Transitions and Animations introduce a sense of seamless transformation between pages, employing fade
                in/out effects to enhance the flow of a page.

                  Database management is an important and powerful tool to efficiently handle and query relational databases.

                  Webhook is a pattern for user-defined callbacks using HTTP. A client can subscribe to events of his choice and receive events, in the form of POST requests, when they happen. A key point of webhooks is that they use HTTP, meaning they do not require new infrastructure to use or implement them.
                  ASP.NET WebHooks provides building blocks for both send and receive operations. 
                  On the receiving side, it provides a common model for receiving and processing events from webhook providers. 
                  On the sending side, it provides support for managing subscriptions and sending events.

                    A stored procedure in SQL is a pre-written and compiled set of SQL commands that are stored within the database catalog. 
                    A stored procedure can be called by an application or triggered by events in the database. 
                    It allows for variable declarations, conditional operations, and other powerful programming features.
                    The key advantages include Performance Improvement by database engine time by not compiling SQL code everytime it
